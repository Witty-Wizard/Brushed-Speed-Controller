# Brushed Speed Controller

This project aims to create a Brushed Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) using KiCad. The ESC is designed to control the speed of a brushed DC motor using pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals.

## Components

### MOSFETs:
- BSC340N08NS3
- ISC037N03L5ISATMA1

### Driver:
- TC4427
